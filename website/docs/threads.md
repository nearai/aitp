# Threads
Threads represent the main communication object between agents. A thread contains all the information exchanged in the conversation. This includes messages, participants and their capabilities.

Threads can be multi-party, supporting adding and removing agents and users.

## Why Chat Threads?

Chat threads are the perfect foundation for agent interactions for several reasons:

**Universal Understanding:**
- Conversations are intuitive for both humans and AI models
- No special training needed for basic interaction
- Natural fallback when structured capabilities aren't available

**Flexibility and Context:**
- Maintains conversation history for context
- Supports both structured and unstructured communication

**Technical Benefits:**
- Easy to persist and retrieve
- Simple to display in user interfaces
- Compatible with existing messaging systems
- Allows for asynchronous communication

**Business Logic:**
- Maps to real-world conversation patterns
- Supports multiple participants
- Can be audited for compliance
- Preserves decision-making history

Natural-language chat is the universal lowest common denominator for agent interaction. You don't need specialized API knowledge or custom UIs to talk to an agent â€“ plain text suffices, while capabilities provide enhanced functionality when available.

## Thread Transports

The transport is responsible for defining how a client communicates with an AI agent.  That client could be a UI or it could be another AI agent.  Each transport must handle:
* Service identification: how do you tell one agent apart from another?
* Service location: how do you connect to the agent?
* Message and metadata encryption
* Operations for creating a thread, adding messages, and viewing history.
* Defining responsibility for managing the state of a thread

### Historical Context

With AITP, we aim to make agent interactions as universal as web browsing. The Web succeeded in the 1990s, beating out closed, curated networks like AOL, largely because HTTP was simple yet powerful - send `GET [url]`, receive HTML. This simplicity drove rapid adoption.

Similarly, chat threads provide an intuitive, universal interface for agent communication. And for better or worse, OpenAI's APIs have become a de facto standard for other AI APIs (e.g. [LangChain Agent Protocol](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agent-protocol), so we adopt the relevant portions of it here as AITP's first supported transport to help with adoption.

## Thread Example

Here's a complete example of an AITP thread with two actors exchanging messages:

```json
{
  "id": "thread_abc123",
  "metadata": {
    "parent_id": null,
    "actors": [
      {
        "id": "user-agent.near",
        "capabilities": [
          {"schema": "https://aitp.dev/capabilities/aitp-01-payments/v1.0.0/schema.json"},
          {"schema": "https://aitp.dev/capabilities/aitp-02-decisions/v1.0.0/schema.json"}
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": "travel-agent.near",
        "capabilities": [
          {"schema": "https://aitp.dev/capabilities/aitp-01-payments/v1.0.0/schema.json"},
          {"schema": "https://aitp.dev/capabilities/aitp-03-data-request/v1.0.0/schema.json"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "messages": [
    {
      "created_at": 1708950000,
      "thread_id": "thread_abc123",
      "content": ["I need to book a flight to Miami next month"],
      "role": "user",
      "metadata": {
        "actor": "user-agent.near"
      }
    },
    {
      "created_at": 1708950060,
      "thread_id": "thread_abc123",
      "content": ["{\"$schema\": \"https://aitp.dev/capabilities/aitp-02-decisions/v1.0.0/schema.json\", \"request_decision\": {\"id\": \"flight_options\", \"type\": \"radio\", \"options\": [{\"id\": \"f1\", \"name\": \"Economy: $299\"}, {\"id\": \"f2\", \"name\": \"Business: $799\"}]}}"],
      "role": "assistant",
      "metadata": {
        "actor": "travel-agent.near"
      }
    },
    {
      "created_at": 1708950120,
      "thread_id": "thread_abc123",
      "content": ["{\"$schema\": \"https://aitp.dev/capabilities/aitp-02-decisions/v1.0.0/schema.json\", \"decision\": {\"request_decision_id\": \"flight_options\", \"options\": [{\"id\": \"f2\"}]}}"],
      "role": "user",
      "metadata": {
        "actor": "user-agent.near"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example:
- Two actors are participating: a user agent and a travel agent
- Each has declared their supported capabilities
- The travel agent is using the Decisions capability to present flight options
- The user agent responds with a structured decision rather than natural language

### Supported Transports

| Transport ID                                             | Description                 | Spec Status | Implementation Status |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| [AITP-T01: Threads API](transports/aitp-t01-threads-api) | OpenAI-compatible HTTPS API | Draft       | Live on NEAR AI       |

Future transports could include anything that allows passing both unstructured and structured data between two or more parties:
* Email
* Chat (Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram)
* [Matrix](https://matrix.org/)
* Peer-to-peer / decentralized networks
* Phone call, plus [ggwave](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggwave)
